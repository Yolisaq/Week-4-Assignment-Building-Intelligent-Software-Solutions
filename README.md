## Contents 📂
- `code_completion.py` – Sort dictionaries manually vs. AI-generated  
- `selenium_login_test.py` – Automated login test with Selenium  
- `predictive_analytics.ipynb` – Random Forest model for resource prioritization  
- `ethical_reflection.pdf` – Bias, fairness, and AI innovation discussion  
- `screenshots/` – Results and outputs

## Key Highlights 🚀
1. **AI-Powered Code Completion 🤖**  
   - GitHub Copilot suggests concise, readable Python code  
   - Speeds up development and reduces boilerplate  

2. **Automated Testing 🧪**  
   - Selenium + AI plugins generate test cases automatically  
   - Detects edge cases and improves reliability  

3. **Predictive Analytics 📈**  
   - Random Forest model predicts priority/resource allocation  
   - Evaluated with accuracy and F1-score  

4. **Ethical Reflection ⚖️**  
   - Mitigates dataset bias using IBM AI Fairness 360  
   - Emphasizes transparency and inclusivity  
   - Proposes **AI-driven automated documentation** tool 📖
